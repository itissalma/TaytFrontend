# Tayt

The frontend repository for the Tayt application, providing its users a virtual try-on experience via creating 3d meshes of their bodies, exploring clothing online, and generating meshes of clothing items to then fit them onto the users' bodies. Tayt also offers users features like recommending compatible items for a clothing item, as well as a rating for an outfit, and an AI-powered search engine to find exactly the clothes you want.
